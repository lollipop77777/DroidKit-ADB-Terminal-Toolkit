## Wireless Debugging Configuration

### Android 11+ Official Wireless Debugging

Android 11 introduced official wireless debugging support without requiring USB pairing first.

> Important: the phone shows its own IP address and pairing port in the Wireless debugging screen. Do not assume the port is always `5555`.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Enable Wireless Debugging**
   - Open **Settings → System → Developer options**
   - Enable ✅ **Wireless debugging**
   - Ensure phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network

2. **Pair Device**
   - Tap **"Wireless debugging"** for detailed settings
   - Tap **"Pair device with pairing code"**
   - Screen will display something like:
     ```
     IP address: 192.168.1.100
     Port: 12345
     Pairing code: 123456
     ```

3. **Computer-Side Pairing**
   ```bash
   # Use the IP and port shown on the phone's Wireless debugging screen
   adb pair 192.168.1.100:12345
   
   # Enter the 6-digit pairing code from phone
   Enter pairing code: 123456
   ```

4. **Connect Device**
   ```bash
   # Use the actual IP and port displayed by the device
   adb connect 192.168.1.100:12345
   
   # Verify connection
   adb devices
   ```

### Android 10 and Below Wireless Debugging

Android 10 and earlier versions require USB connection first to enable wireless debugging.

#### Detailed Configuration Steps

1. **Initial USB Configuration**
   - Complete [USB Debugging Configuration](#usb-debugging-configuration) first
   - Ensure `adb devices` recognizes device

2. **Enable TCP/IP Mode**
   ```bash
   # Enable ADB TCP/IP mode on port 5555
   adb tcpip 5555
   ```
   Success message:
   ```
   restarting in TCP mode port: 5555
   ```

3. **Get Device IP Address**
   
   **Method 1: Via ADB Command**
   ```bash
   # Get device IP address
   adb shell ip route | grep wlan
   ```
   
   **Method 2: Check Phone Settings**
   - Open **Settings → Wi-Fi**
   - Tap connected Wi-Fi network
   - View **IP address** (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

4. **Disconnect USB**
   ```bash
   # Disconnect USB connection
   adb disconnect
   ```
   Then unplug USB cable.

5. **Connect Wirelessly**
   ```bash
   # Connect to device (replace with actual IP)
   adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
   ```
   
   Success message:
   ```
   connected to 192.168.1.100:5555
   ```

6. **Verify Wireless Connection**
   ```bash
   # Check device status
   adb devices
   ```
   Should display:
   ```
   List of devices attached
   192.168.1.100:5555    device
   ```

### Restore USB Debugging Mode

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Problem 1: Device Not Recognized

**Symptoms:** `adb devices` shows device as `unauthorized` or no devices

**Solutions:**
1. Check if USB debugging is enabled
2. Re-plug USB cable
3. Re-authorize debugging on phone
4. Try different USB ports
5. Update or reinstall device drivers
6. Use original USB cable if possible

### ❌ Problem 2: Wireless Connection Failure

**Symptoms:** `adb connect` command fails or times out

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Network Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Test network connectivity
   ping 192.168.1.100
   ```

2. **Verify Port Access**
   ```bash
   # Check if port is open
   telnet 192.168.1.100 5555
   ```

3. **Restart ADB Service**
   ```bash
   # Restart ADB service
   adb kill-server
   adb start-server
   ```

4. **Check Firewall Settings**
   - Ensure computer firewall isn't blocking ADB
   - Temporarily disable firewall for testing

### ❌ Problem 3: Unstable Connection

**Symptoms:** Connection frequently drops or device shows as `offline`

**Solutions:**
1. **Stable Wi-Fi Environment**
   - Ensure strong Wi-Fi signal
   - Avoid peak network usage times

2. **Power Management Settings**
   - Disable Wi-Fi power saving on phone
   - Turn off "Stay awake while charging" in Developer options

3. **Fixed IP Address**
   - Assign fixed IP in router settings
   - Avoid IP changes causing disconnections

### ❌ Problem 4: Authorization Issues

**Symptoms:** Device shows as `unauthorized` in `adb devices`

**Solutions:**
1. **Revoke USB Debugging Authorizations**
   - Go to Developer options → "Revoke USB debugging authorizations"
   - Reconnect and re-authorize

2. **Check RSA Key Fingerprint**
   - Verify the RSA key fingerprint matches
   - Delete `~/.android/adbkey*` only as a last resort if the device still does not trust the computer

3. **Reset ADB Keys**
   ```bash
   # Restart the ADB service and reconnect
   adb kill-server
   adb start-server
   ```
   Then reconnect the device and authorize it again.

## Advanced Tips

### Multi-Device Management

```bash
# View all connected devices with details
adb devices -l

# Execute command on specific device
adb -s <device_id> shell <command>

# Example:
adb -s 192.168.1.100:5555 shell ls /sdcard/
```

### Multiple Device Connections

```bash
# Connect multiple devices
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
adb connect 192.168.1.101:5555

# View all devices
adb devices

# Execute same command on all devices
for device in $(adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf1); do
    adb -s $device shell echo "Hello from $device"
done
```

### Automation Scripts

**Windows Batch Script:**
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting ADB wireless debugging...
adb tcpip 5555
timeout /t 3
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
adb devices
pause
```

**Linux/Mac Shell Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting ADB wireless debugging..."
adb tcpip 5555
sleep 3
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
adb devices
```

### 🔍 Network Debugging

```bash
# View network information
adb shell ip addr show wlan0

# Check ADB service status
adb shell getprop service.adb.tcp.port

# View ADB processes
adb shell ps | grep adbd
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Use wireless debugging only on trusted networks**
2. **Disable wireless debugging after use**
3. **Regularly check authorized debugging devices**
4. **Avoid using wireless debugging on public Wi-Fi**
5. **Keep USB debugging disabled when you are not actively using it**

### Quick ADB Status Checks

```bash
# Confirm the device is connected and reachable
adb devices -l

# Restart the ADB server if the device appears stale or unavailable
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```
